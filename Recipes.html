                <h3>Iraqi Dolma</h3>
                <p>Iraqi dolma is famous throughout the middle east as one of the most delicious types of dolma you'll eat. Vegetables, stuffed with seasoned rice and vegetables and cooked in a tomato broth. There are so many versions of dolma just within Iraq (let alone outside of Iraq), and I love them all. But I'm going to share the one near and dear to my heart; my mom's dolma.</p>
                <h5>Ingredients: <br> 
                   <br> 1 tablespoon olive oil | 2 onions, minced | 1 Â½ cups uncooked white rice | 1 1/2 cups hot water, or as needed to cover | 2 tablespoons tomato paste |
                    2 tablespoons dried currants | 2 tablespoons pine nuts | 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon | 1 tablespoon dried mint | 1 tablespoon dried dill weed |
                    1 teaspoon ground allspice | 1 teaspoon ground cumin | cored eggplants, onions, zucchini, and one green bell pepper</h3>
                 <h5>Directions: <br>
                    <br>
                    Step 1: Preparing the stuffing. This involves finely chopping the vegetables and mixing all the ingredients together <br>
                    Step 2: Preparing the vegetables to be stuffed by coring them/separating them <br>
                    Step 3: Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; this will protect the dolmas from direct heat during steaming. <br>
                    Step 4: Stuffing the vegetables and stacking them in the pot, after adding rips or any kind of meat to the bottom of the pot<br>
                    Step 5: Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked. Check the water level often and add more as necessary. <br></h5>

                <h3> Rice Kubbah</h3>
                <p>Rice kubba are rice filled with a delicious ground beef mixture shaped into little footballs and deep fried until golden and crunchy. My favorite way to eat them is with lentil soup.</p>
                <h5> Ingredietns: <br>
                    <br> 4 cups of Jasmine rice | 1 tbs salt | 1 teaspoon turmeric | 6 cups water | 2 eggs | 2 pounds ground beef | 4 onions | 1\2 teaspoon chili flakes |<br> 1 teaspoon black pepper | 1 teaspoon cumin | 1 teaspoon curry powder | 1 cup parsley (chopped). <br>
                    <br>Directions: <br>
                    <br>
                    Step 1: Overcook the rice by adding water more than the usual cooking amount. When rice is done, mash it well to become like a dough, then add the two eggs and knead. <br>
                    Step 2: Finely chop opnions and parsley, then in a frying pan add them then add all the above mentioned seasonings then add the ground beef until the meat is well done you take it off fire. <br>
                    Step 3: After the rice has cooled down, make small balls of rice then make a hole inside that can fit the stuffing we prepared earlier, then stuff and close, then shape as you like. <br>
                    Step 4: Now you have your Kubbah ready to be fried, either by an air fryer or in a pan filled with hot oil. Cook until they become golden and crispy, then Enjoy! <br>
